# PasswordGenerator
This project generates passwords and stores them in a MongoDB database. It also has a user interface (UI) built in Angular, so you can easily see all of your passwords and the websites they are associated with. The UI also allows you to generate new passwords, so you don't have to worry about coming up with strong and unique passwords on your own.
